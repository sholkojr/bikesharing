## Summary
The key takeaways from the analysis are:
- To increase utilisation, it is suggested to find ways to increase female useage of bikes as they have more "flat useage curves" and would be using bikes off commuter times and 
- Commuter fees must be priced to offset the costs associated with under-utilisation.

Suggested future visualisations include:
- A map based useage visual to provide criteria for optimal location of bike rental stations
- Analysis of bike repair costs based on location, commuter/non-commuter use, gender
